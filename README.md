# overwolf-GEM

Game Events Manager, GEM for short, is an Overwolf app that I initially made for the Nvidia App Challenge, the idea was to pack all of Overwolf features in one app.

After that I had the opportunity to improve the app even further, and ended up winning first place in the Logitech LED Developer Challenge.

## Description

Don't let it fool you with its simple appearance, this app merges the best features of Overwolf in one package.
Select a game, an event and an action, it's that simple, from playing a sound to executing a lighting macro, your creativity is the limit.
